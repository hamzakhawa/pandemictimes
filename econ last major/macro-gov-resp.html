                    <p class="my-1 info">Both the German Federal Government and the German Federal States have enacted a variety of new financial support programs aimed at mitigating the economic consequences that the COVID-19 pandemic has on the German economy. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Germany's lower house of parliament has approved a €750 billion ($814 billion) aid package on Wednesday to cushion the economy from the direct impact of the coronavirus outbreak. In order to fund the emergency measures, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is planning to take on new debt for the first time since 2013. The debt ceiling, which is anchored in German law and limits annual government borrowing, was also suspended in a separate vote on Wednesday. It means the government can take on another €156 billion in 2020 as part of the aid package.  The funds in the program are unlimited and will be available to small, medium-sized and large companies.

                    <h4 class="display-4 heading2 text-center">Other Responses by the Government:</h4> 
                    <p class="my-1 info">Firstly, it is important to note that aggregate demand is falling. Aggregate demand being made up of the same components that make up GDP. These components being consumption, investments, spending of the government, and the net import and export spending.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="display-4 heading2 text-center">What can be done by the government to improve AD?</h4> 

                    <p class="my-1 info">The government has a large role in Aggregate Demand. After all, one of the factors is their spending. If the governments start to increase their spending they can once again shift the Aggregate Demand curve right and increase it. This can be seen in the figure below. This is also known as expansionary fiscal policy, in which the aggregate demand is increased by means of government expenditure.

                      In theory, the German government can possibly cut income tax, which will increase the disposable income of consumers and enable them to increase spending. Higher consumption will increase aggregate demand and this should lead to higher economic growth. In reality this response may not work for Germany as many of the consumers and investors would lack confidence in the market, and would prefer to hold onto their money, rather than spending it.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Alternatively, if the government increased investment in public work schemes, like hospitals, testing clinics, and/or Covid-19 research, this government spending would create jobs, increase incomes and lead to greater aggregate demand.
                      
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="display-4 heading2 text-center">Evaluation of Fiscal Policy:</h4> 
                    <p class="my-3">As mentioned earlier, in theory the policy would work perfectly. But with the current pandemic going on, fiscal policy seems unlikely to be as effective, due to the low consumer and investor confidence. In addition, if the fiscal policy is adopted by the German government, an excess of government spending can lead to crowding out. A phenomenon where the government spends more, but it has the effect of reducing private sector spending. It can also bring about opportunity costs. An increase in spending in one area potentially reduces spending in a different sector.                     </p>
