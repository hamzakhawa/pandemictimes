                    <p class="my-1 info">The price of gold has risen to $1,700 per ounce and economists estimate that the price of gold will continue to rise during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Central banks of China and Russia continue to buy large gold reserves in order to back their respective currencies, as well as reduce the dependence on the US dollar. Buying gold allows nations to spend their currency in the world economy while giving their nations a less volatile asset to hold onto. Historically, the price of gold tends to increase during a recession due to scarcity. Household’s are much safer when they have assets such as gold instead of paper currency, because currency can be debased, which can mean during times of uncertainty the value of paper currency can be very volatile.

                      This supply and demand graph shows the increase in demand for gold. 
                      A shift in the demand curve causes the price to rise to $1,700 per ounce. 
                      Due to the Covid-19 pandemic most gold refineries are closed, which 
                      means the world supply has decreased however the demand for Gold has increased. 
                      This drove the price up to the highest they have ever been.

                    <p class="my-1 info">Gold’s diverse uses, in jewellery, technology and by central banks and investors, mean different sectors of the gold market rise to prominence at different points in the global economic cycle. This diversity of demand and self-balancing nature of the gold market underpin gold’s robust qualities as an investment asset.

                    <h4 class="display-4 heading2 text-center mt-4">Factors of Demand</h4> 
                    <p class="my-2 info">Income: Gold is a normal good, meaning the demand for gold will increase according to the increase in the income of consumers. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Preference: Gold is interwoven with culture, tradition, beauty and for financial protection. Chinese and Indian consumers view gold as both an investment and adornment, so the demand for gold is relatively high compared to cultures that less appreciate gold as tradition. As shown in the graph, China and India constitute the top two countries demanding gold.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Protection: Whether to invest or buy gold is protecting themselves from uncertainty. For example the preference for physical assets makes Indian households view gold as a safe haven, an asset to buy when other assets are losing value.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Inflation: When inflation rises, the value of currency goes down and therefore people tend to hold money in the form of gold, as the value of gold remains stable. Therefore, in times when inflation remains high over a longer period, gold becomes a tool to hedge against inflationary condition.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Interest Rate: When the interest rate of a country decreases, people regard it as a good opportunity to demand more gold as it is a safe and profitable long term investment. When the interest rate increases, people become reluctant to invest in gold as gold is a commodity for long run benefit, not immediately. Therefore, the interest rate and demand for gold have an inverse relationship. As shown in the graph, in the US, the real interest rate and the price of gold for the past 10 years shows an inverse relationship.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Seasons: There is a surge in jewellery demand during the festive and wedding seasons, leading to a rally in gold prices.

                    <h4 class="display-4 heading2 text-center mt-4">Elasticity of Demand</h4> 
                    <P class="text-center font-weight-bold">PED: Elastic Demand</P>
                    <p class="info">
                      Number of Substitutes: There are several substitutes for gold, such as platinum, diamond, silver. The demand of gold will depend on the price of the substitutes. If the price of the substitutes increases, the demand of gold will increase and vise versa.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Proportion of Income Spent: Gold charges a high proportion of income. Therefore, the demand for gold will be highly elastic as 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Luxury or Necessity: Gold is a normal good, specifically a luxury good. Because of this, the demand for gold will increase as the income of consumers rises. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Time Period PED is measured: The longer the time is to measure PED, the demand for gold will be more elastic as consumers will search for alternatives of gold. On the other hand, for the short-run, the demand of gold will remain fairly constant and have a relatively inelastic PED as people didn’t find substitutes for gold yet.

                    <h4 class="display-4 heading2 text-center mt-4">Factors of Supply</h4> 
                    <p class="my-1 info">
                      Cost of Factors of Production: Factors of production consists of land, labour, capital and entrepreneurship. Cost of Factors of production for gold is high, as it requires the high cost of running a gold mine, numerous mine workers, and safety facilities. If the cost of production - such as the income of workers - increases, the supply curve will shift to the left and lead to a decrease in supply.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Technology: The supply of gold depends on the technology available to mine gold. Technically, gold is found on every continent on Earth except for Antarctica. Most of the gold is found in the ocean however we still have not developed technology to extract it all. If there is an advance in technology, the supply of gold will increase, shifting the supply curve to the left. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Government Intervention: There are two types of government interventions. If the government imposes indirect tax, the cost of production increases so the production will decrease, shifting the supply curve to the left. On the other hand, if the government provides a subsidy to producers, the cost of production decreases so the supply increases, shifting the supply curve to the right. In reality, gold is not likely to get subsidies from the government but more likely to have higher indirect tax.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Accidents in Mining: Around 70% of gold production comes from gold mining while the rest are from recycling mostly from jewelries. So if there are accidents in gold mines, the production of gold will drop, shifting the supply curve to the left. 
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="display-4 heading2 text-center mt-4">Elasticity of Supply</h4> 
                    <P class="text-center font-weight-bold">PES: Inelastic Supply</P>
                    <p class="info">
                      Mobility of Factors of Production: If the firms can easily replace factors of production to another alternative to increase production, the supply of the product is elastic. However for gold, the factors of productions aren’t very mobile as gold production requires high technology and complicated procedures. For example, gold producers will find it harder to replace workers as there are only a few people with professional skills. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Spare Capacity: If there is bigger spare capacity, the PES will be relatively elastic as the firms can increase production easily. Typically for gold, the spare capacity isn’t very big as the gold producers are likely to run the production near the maximum already. Spare capacity depends on the size of the company or economic stability of the nation at the time.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Ability to store stocks: The more ability to store stocks, the firms can easily increase production of the product, therefore having elastic supply. Usually, the gold suppliers have the ability to store stocks, likely to have relatively elastic supply.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Time period Considered: In the short term, the PES of would be relatively inelastic as the producers can’t change suddenly increase or decrease the supply. However, in the long run, the PES would be relatively elastic as the producers can find more effective alternatives.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Where is gold found: Technically gold is found on every continent on Earth except for Antarctica. Most of the gold is found in the ocean however we still have not developed technology to extract it all. The largest gold mine on earth  in terms of how much gold is available is in Grasberg in Papua which is a province in indonesia. However, the Basin in South Africa is the richest field so far. According to some estimates, 40% of the gold is found in the Basin.
