                      To fully understand how this epidemic will impact trade, we must narrow it down. Let's look at China, the epicenter for the outbreak and one of the leading manufacturers and exporters in the world. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the country’s manager indices - which is a measure of economic trends in manufacturing - has significantly lowered. How does this tie into international trade, however? What this graph is showing is that from December 2019 to February 2020 there was a 22 point loss in the Index indicating a 22 percent loss in production and therefore a loss in output. The World Health Organization states that this directly affected export rates in the country. It was estimated that there was a 30% reduction in exports from China in a span of 2 weeks. 
distancing protocols in place. Though there were a number of shops that were deemed non-essential which were forced to close down.

 Possible trade barriers to implement.</h4>

                      The virus hasn’t just impacted the world’s ability to export goods, but also to import. There are 3 administrative barriers that can impact a good to be imported into a country. One of these, and the most applicable to this situation is Health and safety standards and environmental standards. As per Harvard Medicine, the virus can stay on surfaces like steel and cardboard for over 2 days. Egypt and Jordan have already suspended a number of imports already from China. These bans on imports are in order to protect product standards and the well being of the citizens of their countries. 

Some ways of fixing this issue, while difficult, can be national sterilization programs. This can be seen in countries like the UAE (Gulf News), where these programmes have been ongoing as well as constant disinfecting of imports. Each package that is transported into the UAE is sterilized and workers use gloves and hand sanitizer when handling the goods. While this can slow the spread of corona and increase trade once again, it has its drawbacks. It can be costly to a country and there can also be a few outliers that aren’t properly disinfected and possibly spread the disease further.

                      Not only is this epidemic impacting physical trade, but  currencies as well. In a report from AirInc, currencies such as the Euro (not significantly), Russian Ruble, Norwegian Krone, Australian Dollar, amongst others have seen a depreciation in value when compared to the US Dollar.

                    <p class="my-1 info" >The diagram (Blink and Dorton), gives a simplified version of how the Russian Ruble has depreciated in value. Demand has lessened but supply has remained constant, therefore lower the price and depreciating the currency. Q1 has moved to Q and the price of Ruble to US has depreciated to 0.9 to the Dollar to 0.8 to the dollar. This is just a brief outline of how exchange rates have also been affected in regard to international trade and economics. </p>

                    <p class="my-1 info">Once again, let us look at China. China is a powerhouse and its relationship with the US has not been the most smooth. The coronavirus has not only impacted their relationships but maybe the end of trade between the two (Wall Street Journal). Donald Trump apparently has been unwilling to negotiate ease on trade restrictions, and Xi-JinPing is unwilling to enter negotiations now. These are the type of issues that can arise from this global pandemic. However, during these times many countries are coming together, With UAE sending aid to Africa, and the US working with a multitude of different countries. The majority of the G20 countries have also come together to create new economic goals and strengthen future relations so after this crisis the worldwide economy can once again prosper (G20 Saudi Arabia).

                      In summary, while the COVID epidemic has impacted our economy and international trade significantly, it can be seen that it will eventually get better and countries are already taking stances to help boost our trade in the near future. However, this is all very easy to say. There is no assurance that countries will fare well in the coming future, just as we thought this epidemic would not be this serious.
