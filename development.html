                      - +34,000 cases

                      <br>
                      <br>
- President Bolsonaro does not believe in social distancing and self isolation, believes the isolation measures are ‘unnecessary drag on the economy’.
<br>
<br>
- If isolation and measures continue, an economic problem will arise with the unemployment and it will take years to be resolved.
<br>
<br>
- Bolsonaro wants schools and shops to reopen with self-isolation only for individuals aged 65+.
<br>
<br>
- Political instability 

<br>
<br>
Brazil is still considered a developing country regardless of its position of exports in the global economy. Corrupt politics, inequality amongst the people as well as a poor health system contribute largely to this. Brazil is probably the most unequal region in the world. 
<br>
<br>
The outbreak of a pandemic such as Covid-19 takes its toll on such a country in relation to its political situation, inequality, health, the currency, etc. Brazil currently has approximately 26000 active cases with more than 1500 deaths, while these numbers continue to increase each and every day.

                    <p class="my-1 info text-center">
                      The root of the problem in Brazil is their own president. President Jair Bolsonaro is putting Brazilians in grave danger by urging them not to comply with social distancing and other measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 from state governments and his own Health Ministry. He has also acted recklessly by disseminating misleading information about the pandemic.
 <br>
 <br>
 
As of April 10, 2020, Brazil had 18,397 confirmed cases of COVID-19, and 974 Brazilians had died from it.  
<br>
<br>
On March 20, Bolsonaro issued an executive order to strip states of the authority to restrict people’s movements to contain COVID-19. Four days later, the Supreme Court revoked that order.
<br>
<br>
On March 26, Bolsonaro issued a presidential decree that exempted churches and lottery houses from state and municipal health regulations by classifying them as essential services, thus allowing people to congregate there. The next day, a federal court suspended that decree, ruling that it violated federal law. The court also barred the government from adopting measures against social distancing enacted by states.
