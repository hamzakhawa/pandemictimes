                      The outbreak of Covid-19 has affected probably every nation’s economy, developing countries in particular seem to struggle greatly due to various factors. Economic development is a multidimensional concept which involves an improvement in standards of living, reduction in poverty, improved health and education along with increased freedom and economic choice. Therefore, a developing country usually has a low level of one or more of these factors. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      While Brazil is one of the world’s ten largest economies, the country is still considered a developing country mainly due to the large level of inequality, political instability as well as a weak health system. A history of corruption in politics as well as political friction weakens the country. 
                    </p>
                   
                    <h4 class="display-4 heading2 text-center mt-4 devTit">Examining how Brazil has been affected:</h4> 
                    <p class="mt-3 info text-center">
                      Brazil currently has more than 34 000 cases and more than 2000 deaths with these statistics rising every day. 
                      The outbreak in Brazil was mainly caused due to the upper-middle class and upper class returning from travel abroad mainly 
                      Italy and Spain. These people who can afford to travel returned with the virus, hence housekeepers became ill due to their 
                      employers. The employers either were not aware of carrying the virus or deliberately kept it from their housekeepers. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      The Governors of Brazil’s largest cities like Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo have already taken measures to impose a quarantine in 
                      these busy cities. Schools have been closed and people were urged to remain inside as a form of self-isolation. President Jair Bolsonaro 
                      does not believe in these quarantine guidelines and is currently known as the world’s most powerful coronavirus denier. 
                      Bolsonaro repeatedly refers to the virus as a ‘little flu’ or a ‘little cold’ and continues visits to supermarkets and bakeries without any form of 
                      protection, shaking hands and publicizing these visits. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Despite repeated warnings and statements of the Health Minister Mandetta proving the need for social-distancing measures and quarantines and possibly
                      the shut down of the country, Bolsonaro refuses to acknowledge the severeness of the virus. Additionally, Mandetta has warned the health system may 
                      collapse by the end of the month, due to their weak health system. As previously stated, the weak health system is a factor that makes Brazil a developing 
                      country. The ignorance of quarantine and social-distancing measures may increase the number of cases, hence overwhelming hospitals and the health sector and will 
                      eventually result in the collapse of the nation’s health system. Mandetta speaks for the majority of the governors and health experts. Moreover, a recent survey 
                      has shown 76% of the respondents support Mandetta’s approach to this pandemic. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Covid-19 is also largely affecting Brazil’s economy. The measures necessary to fight the outbreak of this virus are putting Brazil’s economy on hold. Brazil may have 
                      one of the world’s largest economies, however the country cannot afford to stop the economy from running as it will rapidly find itself in a recession again. In 
                      2015-2016 Brazil experienced a severe economic recession where the economy shrunk by almost 7%. At the start of the pandemic Brazil was still recovering from this economic 
                      crisis however at a minimal pace. The Covid-19 outbreak may pull the country back into a crisis.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4 class="display-4 heading2 text-center mt-4 devTit">Effect on Brazil’s Development</h4> 
                    <p class="mt-3 info text-center">
                      In response to their disagreements, Bolsonaro fired its health minister Mandetta. This shows how the political system is very weak and the virus is affecting Brazil’s development
                      as more political instability arises. The president is unable to agree with the governors of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and other authority figures such as the Health Minister. 
                      his situation slows down the nation’s development, there is an inability of leading the people and controlling a country. The contrasting views of these figures create confusion 
                      and questions for the people as it is unclear for them who they should obey to. Despite Bolsonaro’s poor leadership of the nation, he remains in his position as a president. 
                      The country would not have the ability to survive a political crisis in addition to this health emergency if it were to ask for a new president.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      It appears the main reason for Bolsonaro’s denial is the concern for the country’s economy. The man stated these isolation measures are ‘an unnecessary drag on the economy’ and 
                      that ‘Brazil cannot stop or we’ll turn into Venezuela’. If these isolation measures were to continue, an economic problem will arise mainly with the unemployment, which will take 
                      the nation years to be resolved. As stated in a podcast of The Economist, a local barber in Brazil had attempted to shut down its business, however, after a few days it appeared he
                      became unable to pay his bills when closing the barbershop. Therefore, he opened up again with rules limiting people inside to five. The man does state he works with a constant fear 
                      to become infected but would not be able to survive financially without his job.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Brazil’s current unemployment rate is measured at 11.6%, a relatively high percentage which is not uncommon in developing countries. The unemployment rate is a reason for 
                      the differences between Bolsonaro and health experts. Isolation measures with a lockdown of the country will result in an increase of the unemployment rate. Due to the 
                      coronavirus millions of workers face unemployment and according to a study by Augusta Saraiva the unemployment rate could be doubled over the next months. A drastic rising 
                      level of unemployment will affect Brazil’s development majorly as it will decrease productivity, money flows, GDP,.. Bolsonaro is attempting to avoid this, however, the ignorance 
                      of isolation measures will then affect the health system in Brazil.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      As stated before, Brazil’s health system will collapse if a strict quarantine is not imposed across the country. A deterioration of the already poor health in this country will result 
                      in a fall in the standards of living and hence a worsening of the economic development in Brazil.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      High levels of inequality in the country are becoming a public health issue due to the virus. Brazilians living in favelas - unique, low and middle-income, and unregulated informal settlement 
                      neighborhoods in Brazil that are neglected by the government - like the barber, suffer largely as they cannot rely on government support in financial terms or health. More than 13 million people 
                      live in favelas, which accounts for almost 10% of Brazil’s population. This means roughly 10% of Brazil’s population cannot rely on any professional or governmental health support during this pandemic. 
                      Hence, their chances of surviving the virus decrease, and therefore increasing mortality rates may be the consequence. This will lead to a slower and possibly no economic development of the nation

                      The government has now introduced emergency measures in response to Covid-19, consisting of informal workers 
                      receiving $40 every month. However, as the nation’s currency continues to fall every day, this amount is not 
                      sufficient for families to buy enough food for a month, especially not rent and bills. One US dollar currently 
                      equals five Brazilian Reais. As the diagram below shows, the Brazilian currency is at its lowest nominal level 
                      in the past 25 years. The pandemic plays a big role in the plummeting of the currency due to falling revenues of 
                      oil and especially tourism along with capital outflows to fight the virus. It has created a fear of the economy’s 
                      growth. So far, the Brazilian Real has already lost a quarter of its US dollar value.

                      On the contrary, the Brazilian national debt has fallen in February 2020 compared to the previous month. With a 
                      national debt of 1,290.8 USD bn in February 2020, the amount has fallen by nearly 50 USD bn. This is shown on the

                      As Brazil struggled to pay off debt for some time before the pandemic, the country is expected to be hit more 
                      severely as the pandemic plunges it to crisis mode. This does support Bolsonaro’s view of having to keep the 
                      economy running as it is vital in order for Brazil to survive it financially. The plummeting of the currency due 
                      to the pandemic brings another challenge to the country for surviving as debts become larger as a following. The 
                      government and president have, therefore, prioritized saving lives as well as jobs in order to deal with the economic 
                      difficulty the nation is facing.
